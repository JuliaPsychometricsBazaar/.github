JuliaPsychometricsBazzar is an open shop for Julia packages related to psychometrics. This is taken in a very wide sense and there it no particular roadmap at the moment. If you are interested in participating, please go ahead and join #psychometrics in [Julia slack](https://julialang.org/slack/).

[JuliaPsychometrics](https://github.com/JuliaPsychometrics) is another Julia org for the same topic. At the moment the stewards of that organisation are working semi-privately and are not yet accepting new packages and contributions, however it is possible that they will do in time and we will be able to converge the orgs and have a composable psychometrics ecosystem for Julia.
